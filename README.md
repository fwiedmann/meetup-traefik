### What is not cloud native

-   **Containers**: its not about running applications in container - The way of packaging applications does not mean you get scalability or benefits from autonomous systems like Kubernetes.
    In 2013 Netflix was one of the cloud native pioneers. They deployed almost all their applications as virtual machines images on AWS
-   **Microservices**: benefits of faster, independent development cycles. But monolithic apps can also be manged from autonomous systems
-   **Infrastructure as Code & Configuration Management systems**: automation != autonomous, great for  automating tasks for consistency. But fall short on providing abstractions layers to describe infrastructure beyond one server.
-   **12 Factor apps**: But they share similar traits

### Cloud Native characteristics

-   **Resiliency**:
-   **Agility**:
-   **Operate ability**:
-   **Observability** 

### Cloud Native methods

-   **Microservices:**

-   **Health-Reporting:**

-   **Telemetry-Data:**

-   **Resiliency methods:**

        - Designed for failure
        - Graceful degregation

-   **Declarative, not Reactive:**
